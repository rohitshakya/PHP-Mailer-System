### PHP based mailer system  
#### Many PHP developers need to send email from their code. The only PHP function that supports this is mail(). However, it does not provide any assistance for making use of popular features such as encryption, authentication, HTML messages, and attachments. So I developed a PHP Mailer System using PHPMailer library, which is embedded in a web application used to send emails safely and easily via PHP code from a web server.
### Install Xampp

* For phpmyadmin, sql and apache.
* For database creation and manipulation
* For hosting website locally on your personal system
* Learn Sql queries for database manipulations

#### Default settings and Installation will be  
* Copy the mailer folder and mail.php file in htdocs folder
* Open xampp folder in c:/ drive and search for php.ini file
* Remove semicolon from the beginning of `openssl.dll` line
* [click on link: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps)
* Allow less secure apps
* Edit mail.php and fill the required details like username, password and receiver's address
* Run the mail.php in localhost
